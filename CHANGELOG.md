## Unreleased

- Initial guess now targets the selected SPB or DPB model. SPB estimates its
  Fermi energy numerically from S(T), preserves absolute mass magnitude, and
  chooses the carrier sign. Previously, automatic loading always guessed DPB
  and the SPB button was unavailable. DPB network weights and predictions are
  unchanged. The API adds `numerical_guess` as an initial-guess response.
