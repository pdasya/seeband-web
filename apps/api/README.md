# apps/api

A thin FastAPI layer over `seeband_core`. It holds routes, validation and process management, and no formulas.

## Running

```sh
uv run python -m seeband_api
```

| Variable                | Default     | Applies to                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `SEEBAND_API_HOST`      | `127.0.0.1` | `python -m seeband_api` only               |
| `SEEBAND_API_PORT`      | `8000`      | `python -m seeband_api` only               |
| `SEEBAND_API_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO`      | the API's own log lines, not uvicorn's own |

| Route                   | Purpose                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET /api/health`       | status and version       |
| `GET /api/openapi.json` | the contract             |
| `GET /api/docs`         | Swagger UI over the same |

## Errors

Routes and the app answer errors with this body:

```json
{
  "code": "validation_error",
  "message": "Invalid request",
  "details": [
    {
      "location": ["body", "points", 3],
      "code": "float_parsing",
      "message": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Clients translate by `code`, because `message` is English text for developers. `details` is an empty list unless there is something to list. Routes report errors by raising `ApiError`.

Two kinds of answer do not use this format: uvicorn's plain text 400 for malformed HTTP, which never reaches the app, and the plain text 500 when a `BaseException` escapes.

A validation error leaves out Pydantic's `input` and `ctx`, which hold submitted values. Its `message` or `location` can still quote part of a request: a dictionary key, a field that is not allowed, a discriminator tag or the text of a custom validator. That goes only to the client that sent it, and is not logged.

## Logging

Requests can carry unpublished measurements, so logs must not reveal them. This follows the rule in the `architecture` skill. The data handling decision itself is still open in [F4](https://github.com/pdasya/seeband-web/issues/4).

Each request that reaches the app writes one JSON line to stderr, with `time` in UTC, `level`, `event`, `method`, `route`, `status` and `duration_ms`. `route` is the template, such as `/api/items/{item_id}`, or `<unmatched>` if no route matched. `method` is `OTHER` for a method outside the standard set. `status` is `null` if no response started, such as after a cancellation.

| Not logged               | Why                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bodies and query strings | They hold the data. The server's access log is silenced, as it logs queries |
| Raw paths                | They can hold values, so only the route template is logged                  |
| Exception messages       | A message can quote its input                                               |

An unhandled `Exception` logs its type and its `file:line:function` frames. So debugging starts from the code location, and the value that caused the failure has to be reproduced separately. The frames are those of the outer exception: chained causes and members of an exception group are not listed.

**What this does not cover:**

- **Cancellation and other `BaseException`s** continue to the server, which can print them with their messages and any chained exception. For example, a route cancelled by `--timeout-graceful-shutdown` while handling an exception.
- **Output that bypasses the middleware:** a `print`, `warnings.warn`, an uncaught exception in a thread, asyncio's `Task exception was never retrieved`, and other loggers writing to stderr. So do not put values from a request in warnings or task and thread exceptions.
- **Your own log calls:** a later `logger.info(f"...{data}")` would leak, so do not log values from a request.
- **Other server settings:** uvicorn's `--log-level trace` logs the path, query and headers. With `websockets` installed and WebSockets on, uvicorn logs the path and query of a WebSocket request at `INFO`. `python -m seeband_api` turns WebSockets off, so deployment should start the API this way.

## The contract

`packages/api-client/openapi.json` is generated from this app. See [`packages/api-client`](../../packages/api-client/README.md).
